# N-body simulation with hardware acceleration

## How to build and run

    $ ./build.sh

    $ ./run.sh

A random field of stars is generated and their gravitational interactions are simulated.
The stars are organized in three categories depending on their mass:

- Large stars are colored red
- Medium stars are white
- Small stars are blue

To better visualize the dynamics of the system, stars leave a small visual trace as they are moving.
